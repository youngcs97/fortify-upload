Static Application Security Testing (SAST) identifies security vulnerabilities during the early
stages of development when they are least expensive to fix. SAST reduces security risks by providing immediate security feedback
to developers while they work, enabling them to create more secure software.
<br><br>
Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) uses multiple
algorithms and an expansive knowledge
base of secure coding rules to analyze an
applicationâ€™s source code for exploitable
vulnerabilities. This technique analyzes every
feasible path that execution and data can follow
to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
